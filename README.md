# Certify

Certify is a C# tool to enumerate and abuse misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).

[@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [@tifkin_](https://twitter.com/tifkin_) are the primary authors of Certify and the the associated AD CS research ([blog](https://posts.specterops.io/certified-pre-owned-d95910965cd2) and [whitepaper](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf)).

## Usage

A command overview and comprehensive usage details can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify/wiki).

## Defensive Considerations

Certify was released at Black Hat 2021 with our ["Certified Pre-Owned: Abusing Active Directory Certificate Services"](https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/#certified-pre-owned-abusing-active-directory-certificate-services-23168) talk.

The [TypeRefHash](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2020/06/36164-introducing-the-typerefhash-trh) of the current Certify codebase is:
```
015430f861aaeabd8ede11f450ab472b345883a5b0f5c5d0f92ab8839686db15
```

The TypeLib GUID of Certify is `15cfadd8-5f6c-424b-81dc-c028312d025f`.

This is reflected in the Yara rules currently in this repo.

See our [whitepaper](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) for prevention and detection guidance.


## Compile Instructions

We are not planning on releasing binaries for Certify, so you will have to compile yourself :)

Certify has been built against .NET 4.7.2 and is compatible with [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). Simply open up the project .sln, choose "Release", and build.


### Sidenote: Running Certify Through PowerShell

If you want to run Certify in-memory through a PowerShell wrapper, first compile the Certify and base64-encode the resulting assembly:

    [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\Temp\Certify.exe")) | Out-File -Encoding ASCII C:\Temp\Certify.txt

Certify can then be loaded in a PowerShell script with the following (where "aa..." is replaced with the base64-encoded Certify assembly string):

    $CertifyAssembly = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load([Convert]::FromBase64String("aa..."))

The Main() method and any arguments can then be invoked as follows:

    [Certify.Program]::Main("enum-templates --filter-enabled --filter-vulnerable".Split())


#### Sidenote Sidenote: Running Certify Over PSRemoting

Due to the way PSRemoting handles output, we need to redirect stdout to a string and return that instead. Luckily, Certify has a function to help with that.

If you follow the instructions in [Sidenote: Running Certify Through PowerShell](#sidenote-running-Certify-through-powershell) to create a Certify.ps1, append something like the following to the script:

    [Certify.Program]::MainString("enum-templates --filter-enabled --filter-vulnerable")

You should then be able to run Certify over PSRemoting with something like the following:

    $s = New-PSSession dc.theshire.local
    Invoke-Command -Session $s -FilePath C:\Temp\Certify.ps1

Alternatively, Certify's `/outfile:C:\FILE.txt` argument will redirect all output streams to the specified file.


## Reflections

On the subject of public disclosure, we self-embargoed the release of our offensive tooling (Certify as well as [ForgeCert](https://github.com/GhostPack/ForgeCert)) for ~45 days after we published our [whitepaper](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) in order to give organizations a chance to get a grip on the issues surrounding Active Directory Certificate Services. We also preemptively released some Yara rules/IOCs for both projects and released the defensive-focused [PSPKIAudit](https://github.com/GhostPack/PSPKIAudit) PowerShell project along with the whitepaper. However, we have found that organizations and vendors have historically often not fixed issues or built detections for "theoretical" attacks until someone proves something is possible with a proof of concept.
